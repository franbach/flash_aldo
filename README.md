# Flash Aldo :)

## Heads up

- Backend folder: Don't forget installing all dependencies for Rails (bundle install)
-- rails db:setup
-- rails db:migrate
-- rails db:seed
- Frontend folder: Also don't forget installing all dependencies for the frontend (yarn install)
-- yarn install
- Broadcaster folder: 
-- websocketd --port=8080 ruby inventory.rb

### Make sure to start the processess in this respective order: [the order matters :)]

1. Broadcaster
2. Rails
3. React (vite)
